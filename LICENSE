ScratchLite License
-------------------

ScratchLite is a standalone executable created by bundling the original
August 20th, 2010 Scratch 2.0 beta SWF with the official Adobe Flash Player 10 Projector.

⚠️ Flash Player was officially discontinued by Adobe on December 31, 2020,
and is no longer supported or safe to use on the modern web. However,
this project uses the **offline Flash Projector**, which remains functional
for archival and educational use. It does not require Flash to be installed
in your browser or system.

The original Scratch 2.0 beta software is the intellectual property of the
Scratch Team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).

Flash Player is the property of Adobe Systems Inc.

This project is provided strictly for **educational and preservation purposes**.

You may:

- Use and share this project for personal and educational purposes.
- Study or inspect the SWF using tools like JPEXS.
- Run the EXE on any compatible Windows system, including older hardware.

You may **not**:

- Sell, commercialize, or monetize this project or its parts.
- Claim ownership of the original Scratch or Flash content.
